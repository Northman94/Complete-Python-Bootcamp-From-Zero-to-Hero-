# Iterable =  obj can be iterated over. Go through every element in the Obj.
# Through every letter in a String, every Obj is a List, every Key in a Dictionaryâ€¦

# Syntax of a "for" Loop:

my_iterable = [1,2,3]

for every_elmnt in my_iterable:
    print(every_elmnt);

print("\n");


myList = [1,2,3,4,5]

for numb in myList:
    print(numb)

print("\n");


myList1 = [1,2,3]

for i in myList:
    print("hello")

print("\n");


myList2 = [1,2,3,4,5]

for numb2 in myList2:
    # Check for even numbs
    if numb2 % 2 == 0:
        print(numb2)
