# Iterable =  obj can be iterated over. Go through every element in the Obj.
# Through every letter in a String, every Obj is a List, every Key in a Dictionaryâ€¦

# Syntax of a "for" Loop:

my_iterable = [1,2,3]

for every_elmnt in my_iterable:
    print(every_elmnt);

print("\n");


myList = [1,2,3,4,5]

for numb in myList:

print("\n");

print("\n");

for numb2 in myList2:
    # Check for even numbs
    if numb2 % 2 == 0:
        print(numb2)
    else:
        print(f"Odd Number: {numb2}")


# Difference of TAB usage:

list_sum = 0

for j in myList2:
    list_sum = list_sum + j
    print(list_sum)

print("\n");


listSum = 0

for j in myList2:
    listSum = listSum + j

print(listSum)

print("\n");

print("\n");
