# Random Module:

# Random Module allows us to create random numbers. We can even set a seed
# to produce the same random set every time.

# The explanation of how a computer attempts to generate random numbers is beyond
# the scope of this course since it involves higher level mathematics.

# But if you are interested in this topic check out:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed

# Understanding a seed:
# Setting a seed allows us to start from a seeded psuedo-random number generator,
# which means the same random numbers will show up in a series.
# Note, you need the seed to be in the same cell if your using jupyter to guarantee
# the same results each time.

# Getting a same set of random numbers can be important in situations where you will be
# trying different variations of functions and want to compare their performance
# on random values, but want to do it fairly (so you need the same set of random numbers each time).
