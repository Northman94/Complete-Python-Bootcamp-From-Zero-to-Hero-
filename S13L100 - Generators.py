# Generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back
# a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off.

# Allowing us to generate a sequence of values over time.
# The main difference in syntax will be the use of a "yield" statement.

# Generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their
# execution and state around the last point of value generation.

# The advantage is that instead of having to compute an entire series of values
# up front, the generator computes one value, waits until the next value is called for.
